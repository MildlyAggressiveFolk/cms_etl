# cms_etl

If you are reading this, there is a good chance my resume brought you in.
Welcome! The main entry point is {root}/src/cms_etl/main.py,
and following AppContext therein is a good way to get a quick impression of the app. I appreciate your consideration!

cms_etl is an ETL library featuring an interactive console environment and scripting tools,
used internally to expedite the ETL process for data provided by CMS.gov. Written in Python, primarily leveraging libraries:
- pandas
- sqlalchemy
- rich
- rapidfuzz

Notables:
- \>50% codebase test coverage representing 100% of data mutations.
- Loads latest datasets from CMS and maintains metadata throughout the process.
- Macro exports allow the use of processed datasets directly in scripts, allowing for flexible, non-linear flows when necessary

## Background

My client wanted to get a data loading project underway but was in the middle of a large back-end transition
directly relating to the data in question. Without having the final schema locked in, I wanted a way to do all
of the Extract and Transform ahead of time, essentially leaving only SQL query templating to complete.

In addition to a comprehensive table-editing/macro-building environment, there are utilities for fuzzy matching across
columns/tables, setting types, formatting addresses, etc.

The macro export functionality doubles as a human-readable DSL for ETL flows,
as well as allowing for fully-processed datasets to be used directly in scripts.

I used this project as an opportunity to get some practice with traditional design patterns:
- Adapter Pattern made it easy to support multiple database types.
- Command Pattern allowed me to defer command execution and support macro functionality.
- Factory Pattern is used throughout, often in combination with other patterns.
- Dependency injection is utilized to decouple modules.
